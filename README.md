# Get_Next_Line
- get_next_line is a project that taught me some new concepts like static variables file_desctiptors how they work, how to create them, read and import data from them.
### Goals
- the idea of the project is that u need to create a function that reads one line from a file descriptor each time u call it until it reaches the EOF using static vars so u can preserve their previous value and start from where u finished in the next call.
